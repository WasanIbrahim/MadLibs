# MadLibs
an app with 2 views. The first view should be embedded within a Navigation Controller. You should add a bar button item on the top right of the navigation controller. When pressed the bar button item should segue to a second view with 4 text fields and a submit button. Upon clicking the submit button, the app should unwind back to the first view.   When the app goes back to the first view a sentence should appear like this : "We are having a perfectly (value of textfield1) right now. Later we will (value of textfield2) and (value of textfield3) in the (value of textfield4)".  Use the text from the form to populate a MadLibs sentence.
